Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Requirements
-------------------

Students are required to attend all class sessions and to participate. I do not evaluate class participation in terms of how many brilliant things you say in the course of the semester, but I require you to have read the texts thoroughly and to come to class prepared to talk about them. Failure to attend classes will negatively affect your grade; more than two unexcused absences will drop your grade by a letter, and more than three such absences will be considered grounds for failing the course. In addition, every student will be required to deliver 2-3 presentations on an assigned work during the semester. These presentations, between 10-15 minutes in length, should be conceived as exercises in literary interpretation through close analysis, and should ideally help to stimulate a discussion through arguments and questions.

For each essay assignment, a handout will be distributed detailing requirements and due dates. Feel free to come and discuss with me written assignments before they are due if you have any questions or problems.
